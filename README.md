# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods 2021
Exercises from the course Practical Programming and Numerical Methods 2021.
I was not enroled in the course, but have instead tried to solve some of the exercises in my own time in order to learn the basics of C programming. As such I have not discuessed my solutions with anyone nor have I gotten any feedback. I have not attempted to solve every exercise and my solutions for some exercises are incomplete.
